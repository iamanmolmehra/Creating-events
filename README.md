# Creating-events-View-Project

I have made this project using Express.JS framework of Node.JS, also I have used EJS templating engine for viewing the project. The userfirst have to sign-up and his data will be stored in the local database and then they can login to create a new event, they can update it, delete it and successfully store it.
